					<h4>1710, key year for the copyright</h4>
					<div class="big-col" style="width: 65%; float: left;">
						<p>The origin of the copyright is in the Statute of Anne, an act enacted
						by the Parliament of Great Britain. It was the first law to provide
						public regulation of the copyright and not by private parties.</p>
						<p>It gave legal protection to publishers during the prescribed copyright
						term of 14 years for books, with the possibility of renewal for a similar
						term. Theorically, when the work's copyright expired it would fall into
						the public domain.</p>
						<p>The Statute of Anne had influence in succeeding laws around the world,
						as the Copyright Clause of the United States Constitution and the Copyright
						Act of 1790. It foment the development of copyright treaties until now.</p>

							<p>The Statute of Anne began helding only books, but with the over
							the years the copyright acts were expanding its scope. Nowadays, practically
							everything you can imagine can be copyrightable... But not your imagination!</p>
							<p>Just the expressions of works are copyrightable, not the facts nor
							ideas! Following this principle, you could imagine the composition of
							a song, but you don't want to write it nor publish it. If someone
							record a song like the one you imagine, you can't protest, because
							the copyright protects the expressions of the ideas and facts in tangible
							forms, nor the ideas or facts itself.</p>

						<h4>But, could be copyrighted any creative work?</h4>
						<p>Practically all the creative works expressed are copyrightable, but
						there is some general categories of works, with difference between countries.</p>
						<ul class="small-list">
							<li>Literary and artistic works.</li>
							<li>Translations, adaptions, arrangements and alternations of literary
							and artistic works.</li>
							<li>Collection of literary and artistic works.</li>

						<h4>What is the relationship between copyright, trademark and patents?</h4>
						<p>The "intellectual property" (IP) term is used to refer to the rights
						that grant to creators the possibility to restrict the use of its works.
						The copyright is part of the IP, but it isn't its only tool, there is
						another like the trademark and the patents, among others. Both are related
						with the copyright, but they are not intrinsically necessary with each other.</p>

							goods or services.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="big-col" style="width: 48%; float: right;">
							<p style="font-size: 22pt;">But, is copyrighted?</p>
							<p>No, the EMI logo can't be copyrighted because it doesn't reach
							the threshold of originality, concept used in the copyright law to
							distinguish the original works from which it isn't original.</p>
							<p>Mainly the images composed by basic geometry shapes and text
							aren't copyrightable because it doesn't reachs this threshold.</p>

						<h4>What about patents?</h4>
						<div class="big-col" style="width: 48%; float: left;">
							<p>Patents protect the monopoly of the inventions of an inventor during
							a limited time. A patent not only give the exclusive right to make a
							specific invention, it also grants the exclusive right to make and have made,
							to use and have used, to offer for sale and have sold, and to import
							patentable inventions.</p>
							<p><b>Remember!</b> You don't own the copyright of a creative work
							until you express it in tangible form, like a drawing in a paper sheet.</p>

					<h4>How a person receives copyright protection for their work?</h4>
					<p>If someone want to receive copyright protection for a creative work
					what it is only necessary is to express work in a tangible form: write
					it in a digital document, in a paper sheet, take a photograph, etc.</p>
					<p>You can also register your work with a local copyright authority,
					although this isn't necessary in general to be granted by the copyright protection,
					there is some countries in which may be necessary.</p>
				</section>

						<h4>What is the public domain?</h4>
						<p>It consists of creative works without copyright or that are not a copyrightable
						subject. When the copyright expires the creative work falls under the public domain.</p>

						<h4>How enters a work in the public domain?</h4>
						<ol class="small-list">
							<li><b>The copyright expires</b>. This is the main reason why a work
							fall under the public domain, but it depends of the country in which
							was made the work and where the works is going to be used.</li>
							<li><b>The copyright holder failed to comply with formalities to acquire
							or maintain their copyright</b>. Although there isn't formal requirements
							in most countries, there is cases in which the copyright holder is
							required to fill it in a local copyright authority. <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Template:PD-US-1978-89">
							See the case of USA between 1978 and 1989</a>.</li>
							<li><b>The work was never entitled to copyright protection</b>. Certain
							categories of works fall outside the scope of the copyright, this is
							the case of the legislative, administrative and legal nature works.
							It is usually to find works created by government employees too.</li>
							<li><b>The creator dedicates the work to the public domain before copyright
							has expired</b>. Yes, there is authors that dedicates their works to
							the public domain. This is one of the easiest way to make the works
							globally available.</li>

						<p>If you are asking yourself what you can do with a work in public
						domain, you have to know that...</p>
						<h4>You can make whatever you want!</h4>
						<p>You can reuse, remix, adapt and share the work. And remember, the
						credit to the author is just necessary in some countries, but you have
						to value if it may be better than don't do it.</p>

					<h4>Copyright exemptions</h4>
					<p>The exemptions of the copyright are the uses in which someone can use
					copyrighted works without problems, always respecting the terms of use.
					For example, a write of a newspapers that writes a critic of an art exhibition
					in your city. The exemptions differ by country, but the most common ways are:</p>
					<ul class="small-list">
						<li><b>Listing specific activities</b>. For example, the use of copyrighted
						works in a virtual educational environment. This approach provide a clear
						definition, but anything that doesn't fit with this categories could
						infringe the law.</li>
						<li><b>Include flexible guidelines based on the three-factor test</b>,
						which determines that the use is a special case and the reproduction doesn't
						conflict with the regular explotaition of the work and not prejudice
						unreasonably the interests of the author. This is the <b>fair use</b>,
						although in the United States is determined by the four-factor test
						―purpose and character of the use, nature of the copyrighted work,
						the amount and the substiantiability of the portion taken, and the
						effect of the use upon the market (<a href="https://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/fair-use/four-factors/">Stanford
						Copyright and Fair Use Center</a>)―.</li>

					<h4>Conclusion</h4>
					<p>Copyright is not simple and is to learn all what it involves could
					be hard because the variety of laws and scopes of the different countries,
					in spite of the international treaties. However, it is necessary to know
					to make a world with a more open and free access to the knowledge, because
					the copyright is the base for the most of the creative works in the world.</p>
