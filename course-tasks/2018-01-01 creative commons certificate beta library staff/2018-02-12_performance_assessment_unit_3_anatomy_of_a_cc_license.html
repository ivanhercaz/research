						<h4>Are CC's licenses against the copyright?</h4>
						<p>«Creative Commons licenses are copyright licenses»</p>
						<p>Based on this statement, there is two keys about the licenses that
						everyone must to know:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>The licenses are applied when the prohibitions of copyright, or
							similar laws, apply.</li>
							<li>The licenses don't cover other rights as patents, trademarks,
							privacy and publicity rights.</li>
						</ol>
						<p>Creative Commons licenses are built on the copyright, the licenses
						are supported by legal text based on laws.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>So, what makes the licenses?</h4>
						<p>The licenses are using by creators who want to provide to the public
						some of the rights reserved by the author.</p>
						<p>All Rights Reserved (c) vs Some Rights Reserved</p>
						<p>The copyright reserved all the rights for the author, but the author
						may want to provide another conditions to share and use a work:</p>
						<div class="block">
							<p>Examples</p>
							<img style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" src="../img/cc-by.png"
							alt="Creative Commons Attribution licence's button" />
							<p>Chris Zabriskie, a musician, share his works freely with the only
							requirement to credit her work. <a href="http://chriszabriskie.com/licensing/">
							Check his "Licensing" page</a></p>
							<img style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" src="../img/cc-by-nc.png"
							alt="Creative Commons Attribution NonCommercial licence's button" />
							<p>Wired.com shares the works produced by its employees for
							non commercial purposes and it requires to be attributed. <a href="https://creativecommons.org/2011/11/07/wired-com-now-releasing-photos-under-cc-attribution-noncommercial/">
							Check the new!</a></p>

						<h4>Copyright's exceptions and limitations</h4>
							<p>The licenses can't affect to the exceptions and limitations to
							copyright. If your work can be used in a manner allowed by an exception
							or not covered by the copyright laws, you can't license it with the
							purpose of reduce, limit or restrict this conditions.</p>
							<p>About the Similar Rights (as CC define "neighbouring rights" in
							the legal code of its licenses), CC's licenses only play a relevant
							role when it this rights are applied to the work <b>and a specific
							reuse made by someone</b>.</p>
							<p><b>Remember!</b> CC's licenses can't restrict works that can be used
							applying the fair use or fair dealing exceptions.</p>
					</section>

						<h4>What happens with the public domain??</h4>
						<p>If a work is in the public domain, it isn't subject to copyright, either
						because the work reached its copyright term or the author released it
						into public domain.</p>
						<p>Thus, if a work is in the public domain, a CC's license couldn't be
						used to reduce, limit or restrict the work. <br />It's free!</b></p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>CC0 and Public Domain Mark</h4>
						<p>Creative Commons provides ways to release content in the public domain
						and identify the works in the public domain.</p>
						<img style="width: 250px; float: left; margin-right: 10px;" src="../img/cc-zero.png" alt="Creative Commons Zero Public Domain Button" />
						<p style="font-size: 18pt">With this tool anyone can release a own work into public domain.
						It can be used to waive the copyright (and database) rights) that
						you may have under the laws of at least one jurisdiction, although
						it is free of any restriction in another countries.</p>

						<img style="width: 250px; float: left; margin-right: 10px;" src="../img/CC_Public_Domain_Mark.png" alt="Creative Commons Public
						Domain Mark" />
						<p style="font-size: 18pt">It isn't a tool! It's just a mark. It is like a sticker in your
						work, sticky with the purpose of advise the public that the work is
						in the public domain. It also makes easier to identify the works,
						without calculate the years, the copyright term of each country, etc.</p>

					<h4>Conclusion</h4>
					<p>Creative Commons offers a suite of licenses that can be adapted to
					the necessities or interests of anyone, instead the licenses are very
					easy to use and to understand, thanks to its three layers design.</p>
					<p>At the of that presentation, I want to invite you to debate with three
					main questions.</p>
					<p>Are you for or against the NonCommercial and NonDerivative conditions?
					In what context you would use it? Why?</p>
