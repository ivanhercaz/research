# About

I am working in this site! It is my academic and research repository. I hope to have it prepared to be accessible to my works as soon as possible.

## Table of contents
- [Course tasks](https://ivanhercaz.github.io/research/course-tasks/)
- [Talks](https://ivanhercaz.github.io/research/talks/)

## Pending tasks
- List of all the images used in the course tasks and specifying its license and
its provenance.
- Redesign this site!
- Change the structure of current folders without underscores (_).
- Move reveal.js from the folders to /core, to avoid unnecessary duplications.
- Create a "blog-posts" or "blog-entries" folder to make a backup of [my blog posts](https://ivanhercaz.com/blog)
